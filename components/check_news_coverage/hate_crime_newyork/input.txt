Police are seeking a suspect after an Asian woman was injured in a hate crime attack on a city bus late last month. The 51-year-old woman was on a city bus in the Bronx on March 28 when an unidentified woman and three teenage girls began making anti-Asian comments to her, police said. The woman then attacked her, hitting her on the head with an umbrella, before fleeing the bus, police said. The woman was taken to a hospital nearby, where she received stitches. Three 15-year-old girls were charged with hate crime assaults, menacing and harassment shortly after the incident. The police department's Hate Crime Task Force is seeking the woman.
