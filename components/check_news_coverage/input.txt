It doesn't get much more liberal than Michael Moore. The guy as speaking at women's marches for goodness sake, and he's so liberal that women don't let him. He seems to have built his entire career on career solely on criticizing people (especially conservatives) and for some reasons, people love him for it. Unlike most liberals though, Moore isn't discriminatory with who he gets fed up with, and this time, it's own party. Apparently, the Michigan-born Democrat was ready for a win in the much-anticipated Georga speaking election and he's little ticked off that he did't get it, which caused this ultra liberal to say what the rest of us have been thinking about the Democratic party. Liberal activist Michael Moore lashed out at national democrats on Wednesday after the party fell short in a special house runoff election in Georgia despite spending tens of millions of dollars on a race that was viewed as a referendum on president Trump.
